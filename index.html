                <p> My name is Itsede Joy, I hail from one of the Southern states in Nigeria Edo State" Estako Central
                    local Government area. I finished my primary school education in the year 2005 from L.E.A Kurudu,
                    Abuja after which I proceeded to Junior Secondary School Jikwoyi Abuja and graduated in the year 2008
                    before attending Nobel Stars College Ikorodu, Lagos state and graduated in the year 2012. I continued
                    to pursue a national diploma at Auchi Polytechnic, Edo state at the department of Ceramics and glass
                    technology. In 2015 I went on to attend University of Ilorin, Kwara state to study Educational
                    Technology.I further did my M.ed at National Open University of Nigeria at the department
                    of Educational Technology.
                    <p> I joined Alt School Africa to study Frontend Engineering for a year because I want to become tech savy 
                        while developing a skill that is needed in the technological field and will still be in demand in few years
                        to come. 
                        My goals for the school of engineering program is to ensure that I utilize to full capacity all 
                        the resources both human and non human that have been put in place to expose me to the needed knowledge and
                        skills to become a well grounded frontend developer.
                        I also want to gain this skill because I intend to travel out of the country soon and i want
                        to ensure that I gain a skill that is in high demand so that I will not be stranded.
                        I currently work as a pre school teacher but there is need to have multiple source of income
                        I don't want to restrict myself to the educational field alone so I am trying to venture into
                        Tech.
